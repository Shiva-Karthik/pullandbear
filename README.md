# pullandbear
Unit-2 Construct week project

Hello Readers, In this blog we are going to discuss how our team of four members built clone of pullandbear.com (Online Clothing Store) which is our first project in Masai School. In this website we used HTML, Javascript and CSS only and tried to incorporate most of the features of the website.


Normal process follows like :

You click on country selection page where you select country
In gender selection page you select your gender
There are two home pages one for man other for woman
In home pages you can select your preferred clothing pages
In clothing pages on clicking any image you get product description
After going to pages you can add product to your cart
After adding to cart you go to shopping bag page from homepage
Then in bag you can process your order till payment
After payment you will be redirected to homepage
